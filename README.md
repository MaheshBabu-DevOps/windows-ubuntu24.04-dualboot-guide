🔹 Introduction
What is Dual Boot?
Dual booting allows you to run both Windows and Ubuntu on the same computer. You can choose which OS to boot into when you start your computer.

Why Dual Boot?
✔ Run Linux alongside Windows without removing Windows.
✔ Learn and develop in a Linux environment while keeping Windows for other tasks.
✔ Great for developers, students, and tech enthusiasts.


🔹 Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
✅ A USB Drive (8GB or more) for creating a bootable Ubuntu installer.
✅ Windows Installed on your PC (we will install Ubuntu alongside it).
✅ Backed Up Important Data (Partitioning a disk can be risky).
✅ A Stable Internet Connection for downloading Ubuntu and updates.


🔹 Step 1: Download Ubuntu 24.04 ISO
🔹 Download Ubuntu 24.04 LTS from the official Ubuntu website:
👉 Ubuntu Official Download
💡 Choose the 64-bit version for most modern systems.


🔹 Step 2: Create a Bootable USB
You need to create a bootable USB with Ubuntu. You can use:

✔ Rufus (Windows)
✔ balenaEtcher (Windows & Linux)

✅ Using Rufus (Recommended for Windows)
1️⃣ Insert your USB drive into your computer.
2️⃣ Open Rufus and select your USB device.
3️⃣ Click SELECT and choose the Ubuntu 24.04 ISO file.
4️⃣ Under Partition Scheme, select GPT (for UEFI) or MBR (for Legacy BIOS).
5️⃣ Click START and wait for the process to finish.


🔹 Step 3: Configure BIOS Settings
Before installing Ubuntu, you may need to change BIOS settings:

✅ Disable Secure Boot – Required for smooth installation.
✅ Enable UEFI Boot (if using GPT partition).
✅ Set USB as First Boot Device – To boot from the USB drive.

✅ Access BIOS
1️⃣ Restart your PC and press the BIOS key (F2, F12, Del, or Esc) during startup.
2️⃣ Navigate to Boot or Security settings.
3️⃣ Disable Secure Boot and enable UEFI mode.
4️⃣ Save and exit.


🔹 Step 4: Create Space for Ubuntu
You need free space on your disk for Ubuntu.

✅ Shrink Windows Partition (Using Disk Management)
1️⃣ Open Disk Management (Win + X → Disk Management).
2️⃣ Select your C: drive and click Shrink Volume.
3️⃣ Allocate at least 50GB for Ubuntu.
4️⃣ Click Apply, and you’ll see Unallocated Space.


🔹 Step 5: Install Ubuntu Alongside Windows
1️⃣ Boot from the USB – Restart your PC and select Boot from USB.
2️⃣ Select "Try Ubuntu" – To check if everything works fine before installing.
3️⃣ Click "Install Ubuntu" and choose "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows".
4️⃣ Allocate disk space for Ubuntu (Use the free space created earlier).
5️⃣ Select your timezone and create a username & password.
6️⃣ Click "Install Now" and wait for the process to complete.


🔹 Step 6: Post-Installation Setup
✅ Fix Boot Order (If Needed)
If Windows overwrites the GRUB bootloader, fix it using Boot-Repair:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y boot-repair
boot-repair

✅ Update Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
✅ Install Drivers (WiFi, GPU, etc.)
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall

🔹 Troubleshooting Common Issues
❌ Windows Boot Manager Not Showing Ubuntu?
🔹 Open BIOS and set Ubuntu as the first boot option.
🔹 Run Boot-Repair using the command above.


❌ Black Screen on Boot?
🔹 Try booting with nomodeset:

1️⃣ During boot, press Esc and select Ubuntu.
2️⃣ Press E to edit the boot entry.
3️⃣ Add nomodeset after quiet splash.
4️⃣ Press F10 to boot.

❌ WiFi Not Working?
🔹 Connect via Ethernet and run:

sudo apt update
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
